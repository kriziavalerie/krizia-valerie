Reflection

<p id="paragraph"> 

I was wronged, been hurt, left alone. I have been completely lost, I have forgotten how to smile, laugh and live. I can't understand which chapter of my life was directed in a  wrong way, what line of the script did I forgot, which part was not played? Many years of my life was wasted. I was wondering when did the colors turn to gray? When did I start to lose my voice, when did I start to lose visions of my perfect future, when did I start to lose my melody? 
Well, have you noticed? I have lots of questions didn't I? You shouldn't wonder. I am a question myself. 
But then, let's skip to the good part. Recently, I have been doing a lot of proof reading of my story, I was skimming and scanning for quite a lot about myself. Specially, when I heard about the different lessons of understanding ourselves. Guaranteed, it was not easy, but everything about being knowledgeable about our own self are worth it. 
<br>
<br>
Assesing my material self, to be honest, I love posessing things that I think would make me happy, yet, when I finally purchased that certain thing, I can still feel a void in my life. I was like, hmm still doesn't satisfy me. Therefore, I focus on things that really satisfies my needs and wants. I want to posses things that would really make me happy. 
Assessing my digital self, I am happy that my 13 year old self was very proud of me. When it comes to social media, I am proud that I am a very private person. I make sure that I portray myself as what I should be. Just smart and peaceful. Not everything is bound to post online. Private is peace. 
Assesing my spiritual self, we are raised to be a religious person. Growing up, my parents make sure that we are attending every meetings on Sunday, also, we are always reminded of how life will be good, if we keep our faith in God. I can attest to that, I know how powerful God is, even if we are completely lost in our track. As long as you are sincere of everything that was good for ourselves, God will always find a way for us. 
Here we are, to my political self. If I were to be honest, I don't engage much with political issues. But then, I improve my political self in a way that I educate people with what I think is the best. That's the only way I can influence people about my political standards. I don't participate with arguments and debates. In that way, I can still find my peace. 
<br>
<br>
Life has been quite a journey for me. I have been living for 20 years in this world. But for me, I lost some years of my life. Remembering my elementary and junior high school self, I have been a consistent honor student, if I weren't the best, I make sure I'm the second best. I participate with different extra curricular activities, I am a school representative, journalism, drum and lyre, mathematics quiz bee, science quiz bee, even joined the research team,  and in sports. I am really fond of making a name for myself, but then things happened, and I suddenly see myself lost interest with everything. Even so, I still manage to maintain my grades in 90, yet, I know, part of me is missing that succesful era of mine. 
<br>
<br>
Today, I am slowly gaining my confidence, I am eager to completely regain myself. I trust my own process, and I will completely trust myself again. This year, I detox myself. I made my circle small and relevant. I completely detached myself with the negative people and things in my life. I started forgiving people who had done me wrong, and enrolled myself in different activities that I want. This is my way to do improve my relationship with myself. Soon, I can bring back my healthy competitive self. 
I can completely say that I become a very nice person today, my journey was tough, but it taught me lot of good and positive outlook in life. I become wiser and stronger. 
In order to have a clean and peaceful environment, all that we have to do is to impose a positive and powerful mindset in life. It's all about our perspective. If you know that you are clean, prove it with your actions. Mind your own business, focus on your growth, stop all the negatives, and do what makes you happy, do what you love. Focus on your passion, sooner, you won't notice how much of a great person you become.

I am Krizia Valerie Albero, I am proud of myself, I am a powerful woman.
